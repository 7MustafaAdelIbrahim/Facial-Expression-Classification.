## About our dataset.

We've worked on [fear-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) a popular dataste from kaggle.

Fer2013 contains approximately 30,000 facial RGB images of different expressions with size restricted to 48×48, and the main labels of it can be divided into 7 types: 0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral. The Disgust expression has the minimal number of images – 600, while other labels have nearly 5,000 samples each.
